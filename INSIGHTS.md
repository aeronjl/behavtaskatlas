## 2026-04-24 16:00:43 BST - Working name and implementation defaults accepted

The working project name is **behavtaskatlas**. The accepted MVP defaults are YAML-authored records, Python validation tooling, Pydantic-style schemas, `uv` for local Python workflow, strict identifiers/provenance/vocabularies, permissive handling of complex task details, IBL visual decision as the first deep vertical slice, and three initial exemplar tasks: IBL visual decision, random-dot motion discrimination, and auditory click/evidence accumulation.

The next implementation step is to create a buildable repository scaffold with schemas, vocabularies, seed records, and validation before expanding the catalog.

## 2026-04-24 15:58:27 BST - Defer hosting and start with MVP foundations

Hosting and deployment should be deferred while the MVP proves its core scientific and technical structure. The next phase should focus on the file-first foundations: schemas, controlled vocabularies, exemplar task records, validation tooling, and one first vertical slice that connects a task record to dataset metadata and analysis expectations.

The immediate work should proceed in dependency order: stabilize the object model, draft the first schema, create three high-quality exemplar task records, build validation, then expand only after the schema has been tested against real task variation.

## 2026-04-24 15:55:40 BST - Hosting should separate publication, computation, and storage

The preferred MVP hosting architecture should separate the public catalog from scientific computation. A static site on Cloudflare Pages or Workers static assets can serve the catalog, while Python validation and analysis jobs run in CI or batch environments and publish derived artifacts. Cloudflare R2 is a good fit for exported JSON, harmonized trial tables, figures, and release artifacts; D1 or a prebuilt search index can be added only when static filtering becomes insufficient.

Although Cloudflare Python Workers now provide a first-class Python experience, they should not be the first home for heavier scientific Python workloads such as pandas/scipy/model fitting. Request-time Workers are better suited to APIs, search, redirects, metadata lookup, and small validation endpoints. The MVP should remain file-first and rebuildable from git.

## 2026-04-24 15:51:29 BST - Technical depth is in representation, not the website

The deeper implementation challenge is not building a catalog interface; it is designing representations that make tasks comparable without flattening away scientifically important differences. The MVP needs stable identifiers, schema versioning, provenance, validation, ontology boundaries, task-family inheritance, trial-table harmonization, executable or semi-executable task specifications, and reproducible analysis outputs.

The core technical problem is to connect four levels cleanly: abstract task family, concrete protocol, dataset/session/trial data, and model or analysis result. If these levels are conflated, the atlas becomes ambiguous. If they are separated too rigidly, contribution becomes too burdensome. The MVP should therefore use pragmatic files and schemas first, while leaving room for a graph model and formal ontology later.

Immediate technical design decisions should focus on identifiers, schema evolution, controlled vocabularies, task inheritance, temporal/event representation, data adapters, validation tooling, and provenance of derived analyses.

## 2026-04-24 15:48:53 BST - MVP should prove vertical usefulness

The MVP should not optimize only for the number of cataloged tasks. It should prove a complete user path: a researcher can discover a task family, inspect its operational variables, compare variants, find linked data, run or inspect baseline analyses, and understand how to contribute a better record.

The most persuasive MVP shape is therefore a hybrid of breadth and depth: 30-50 lightly curated task records for map coverage, plus 3-5 deeply curated vertical slices with schema-complete task records, linked open data, harmonized trial tables, generated psychometric/chronometric summaries, and documented provenance. This prevents the project from becoming a static bibliography while keeping the first release achievable.

Key decisions now include the exact anchor task families, whether the first release prioritizes rodents only or cross-species comparison, the minimum required fields for a task record, the canonical trial-table format, the treatment of cognitive labels as claims rather than facts, and whether the first public surface should be a static site, a Python package plus docs, or both.

## 2026-04-24 15:45:51 BST - Initial project framing

The proposed enterprise is feasible, but the impactful version should be more than a repository of psychometric tasks. The stronger project is a **task atlas for behavioral neuroscience**: a machine-readable map linking task design, trial-level data, implementations, protocols, and model fits.

The analogy to Tim Vogels' ion-channel database is useful because the value comes from classification plus quantitative comparison. In this project, tasks should not merely be listed; they should be described through comparable variables such as modality, stimulus statistics, evidence structure, choice geometry, action mapping, feedback and reward rules, timing, priors, blocks, training regimes, apparatus, species, and common variants.

The current ecosystem appears strong on adjacent infrastructure but weak on this exact object. Relevant neighbors include Cognitive Atlas for cognitive task concepts, OpenBehavior for behavioral tools, NWB/DANDI/BIDS/HED for data and event standards, and IBL as a proof that standardized decision tasks plus open data can work across laboratories. The gap is a task-centered, cross-species, comparative database for sensory and decision paradigms.

The project should be built in layers:

1. **Task ontology**: operational task variables first, interpretive cognitive claims second.
2. **Trial-level data layer**: harmonized behavioral trial tables, with raw neural data linked rather than duplicated where possible.
3. **Analysis and model layer**: standard psychometric, chronometric, history-dependent, GLM, drift-diffusion, reinforcement-learning, and ideal-observer fits.
4. **Executable task layer**: reference implementations or links for PsychoPy, jsPsych, Bonsai, pyControl, Bpod, and related systems.
5. **Comparison interface**: ways to search for similar tasks, contrast variants, and identify available datasets or fitted models.

The recommended MVP should be narrow: sensory-guided decision-making tasks in rodents, primates, and humans. A first target of 30-50 canonical tasks is plausible, including random-dot motion, contrast discrimination, auditory clicks, vibrotactile flutter, go/no-go detection, the IBL visual decision task, evidence-accumulation tasks, confidence/report tasks, and dynamic foraging-style variants.

The hard parts are curation, incentives, and ontology discipline rather than software alone. The project will be most transformative if it helps laboratories before publication: choosing tasks, reporting them cleanly, depositing data, and comparing new experiments against known task families.
